# Synthespider

This is a simple additive synthesizer instrument. It was developed as a project for the Computer Music: Languages and Systems course in [Politecnico of Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) (MSc in Music and Acoustic Engineering).

The synthesis part is implemented through SuperCollider, the user interface using Processing.

A video demo is available at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vcry4BAyGyOUnh2XWtkcOh09h921hDiB/view?usp=sharing).

Have fun!
